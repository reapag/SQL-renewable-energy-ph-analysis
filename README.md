# Renewable Energy Analysis - Philippines (2000-2023)

## Project Overview
This project uses data from IRENA to explore renewable energy capacity, generation, and growth in the Philippines. The analysis focuses on key metrics such as:

- Total renewable energy capacity and its year-on-year growth
- Renewable energy sources (e.g., wind, solar, hydro)
- Comparison between renewable energy generation and installed capacity

## SQL Skills Demonstrated
- Data preparation and cleaning
- Use of window functions to calculate growth rates
- Analysis of renewable energy share in the Philippines' energy mix
- Performance optimization using subqueries and `WITH` statements
